                E-waste, or electronic waste, refers to any discarded electronic device or equipment. E-waste can
                contain
                hazardous materials that can harm human health and the environment. As EVs rely on batteries, concerns
                have
                arisen about the potential for these batteries to become a significant source of e-waste.

                The issue arises because of the nature of the batteries used in EVs. Lithium-ion batteries,
                which are currently the most common type of battery used in EVs, are made up of various materials such
                as cobalt,
                nickel, and lithium. While these materials are recyclable, the recycling process is currently expensive
                and requires
                a significant amount of energy.

                Digital carbon footprint is an aggregate of the emissions created by the lifecycle of a device or
                software, including its creation,
                usage, and maintenance. The first stage is the production of hardware devices, such as laptops, phones
                and microprocessors, when the
                machines that manufacture devices generate significant carbon dioxide.Green Computing focuses on
                improving energy efficiency and
                minimising the environmental impact of computer systems to create a lower digital carbon footprint for
                the production and
                consumption of hardware and software.

                <strong>Recycling is possible over electronic Component ?<br><br></strong>
                Each year, about 50 to 60 million tons of e-waste are generated,

                Yet, the damage that this amount of waste poses to our health and the environment may exceed the
                destructive power of all
                other wastes combined. Since e-waste contains toxic materials, such as lead, cadmium, and beryllium,
                once it is exposed to strong
                UV radiation it corrodes due to any other physical or chemical reasons, toxic materials could be
                released into the atmosphere,
                infiltrate the soil, and flow into the water bodies nearby, affecting public health and enviroment. The
                e-waste left behind that is not functional will be
                sent to recycling processing.
                Here, e-waste is thrown into an enormous machine and is shredded into tiny pieces, but before that, it
                must first go through a process
                called de-manufacturing.

                Mercury is primarily absorbed into the human body by breathing airborne vapors, and it is these vapors
                that make not only
                waste electrical and electronic equipment dangerous for those who deal with it, but also workers who
                produce it,
                which lead to health problems such as losing color discrimination. Other research has shown that mercury
                exposure can
                lead to long-term damage to information processing, and psychomotor functioning, as well as increased
                depression and anxiety.
                Children have been shown to be particularly sensitive to mercury vapors, and newborns and infants can be
                at greater risk if
                they live near informal recycling industries Long-term exposure can lead to nerve and brain damage and
                birth defects.

                E-waste is short for electronic waste.

                Typically, these electronics often contain toxic chemicals and hazardous materials. Hence, when not
                properly disposed of, these electronics can cause the release of toxic substances into our environment.
                E-waste recycling then refers to the reprocessing and re-use of these electronic wastes.
                It’s just that simple.
                These electronic wastes may be in the form of home appliances like air conditioners, televisions,
                electric cookers,
                air condoners, heaters, DVDs, fans, microwaves, and radios.
                of course, information tech equipment like your computers, laptops, mobile phones, batteries, hard
                disks,
                circuit boards, and monitors still fall under the category of e-waste once they’ve served their purpose.

                    To dispose of e-waste properly, take it to certified e-waste recycling centers or collection events.
                    Don't throw it in regular trash. Recycling facilities can safely extract valuable materials and
                    dispose of hazardous substances. Additionally, consider donating or reselling still-functional
